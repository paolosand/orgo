Clone the main branch

When making a pull request, please create a separate branch and name it in the format <yourname>-<feature implementation>. 
Ex. I've finished the splash screen I will upload the splash screen object files in a folder and push it to a branch called vitus-splashscreen

We will merge everything to a final release branch once everything works
